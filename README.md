Human-Activity-Data
===================
Aggregation and summary of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to produce high-level means for the experimental data made available by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  The original dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### This repository includes the following files:
* README.md
* CodeBook.md : information about the variables per observation
* run_analysis.R : processing and summary script
* ActivityDataSummary.csv : output average reading per subject and activity

### Script execution
The script assumes that the original UCI data has been extracted to its working directory in a directory named 'UCI HAR Dataset'. The original data set can be downloaded from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)
